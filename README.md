# Blast
This repository is my implementation of an AI agent that learns how to play BlockBlast using Reinforcement Learning. (work in progress)

It is built on top of a fork of this repository (https://github.com/Kefrov/Blast/) that implements the BlockBlast game in PyGame. 

## Dependencies
- Python
  - [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) â†’ Install with:  
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
    or use Conda

## How to Run
- To run the game, use:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
